### TLE7232G

A C++ object to control the Infineon Spider TLE7232G SPI driver for
enhanced relay control. Eight channel low-side switch. For the Arduino
Platform.

### Introduction

The SPIDER - TLE7232G is an eight channel low-side power switch in
PG-DSO-24-13 package providing embedded protective functions. It is
especially designed for standard relays in automotive applications.  A
serial peripheral interface (SPI) is utilized for control and
diagnosis of the device and the load. For direct control, there is an
input pin available.  The power transistors are built by N-channel
vertical power MOSFETs. The device is monolithically integrated in
Smart Power Technology.
